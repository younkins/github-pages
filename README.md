# Roundabout Design
This section details the requirements and guidelines for roundabout design.

## Vehicle Path Simulation
- Use **AutoTURN** software for vehicle path simulation.
- Design vehicle specifications are outlined in **Table 203.2**.
- Simulations must:
  - Ensure vehicles navigate the roundabout without tracking over the truck apron.
  - Demonstrate that buses operate properly within the circulatory roadway.

## Sight Distances
Refer to Section 9.5 of **NCHRP 1043** for guidance.
- **Stopping Sight Distance (SSD)**:
  - Visibility between a driverâ€™s eye height (3.5 feet) and an object of the same height.
  - Calculated using the following formula:
    ```
    SSD = ...
    ```
- **Intersection Sight Distance (ISD)**:
  - Ensure clear sight triangles as shown in Exhibit X.X.
